                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Poshmark is an existing application I was tasked to redesign. It is a mobile application where users
                    can either sell clothing they no
                    longer wear or buy clothing at discounted prices. The appeal of this application is users can buy
                    high end brands, such as Zara
                    and Madewell, at steep discounts. Along with this, sellers can earn some supplemental income from
                    selling what they have in their closets.
                </p>
                <p>Based on Poshmark’s designated function, to buy and sell used clothing, I asked five different people
                    to do two tasks. The first is to find three items they would like to own, and act as if they were
                    going to buy them. The second is to take an article of clothing in their closet and put it up for
                    sale. Based off of their experiences I came up with the following flaws and plan on how to fix them.
                </p>
                <h2>Flaws and Fixes</h2>
                <p>Below is a list of the seven factors that define user experience and my thoughts on how the app
                    portrayed them:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Useful:</b> There are a multitude of apps out there similar to this one, and a lack of
                        usability could cause this app to get lost among all the others.</li>
                    <li><b>Useable:</b> Somewhat usable. It can be difficult to specify what a user is looking for, as
                        well as
                        navigate other features, which could cause them to turn away from the app. </li>
                    <li><b>Findable:</b> This goes alongside usability. It can be troublesome to navigate through the app
                        to find
                        what you are looking for.</li>
                    <li><b>Credible:</b> There is a lack of credibility in this app, considering anyone can post what
                        they please without restrictions. </li>
                    <li><b>Desireable:</b> I would say this app, as well as apps like this, are desirable as more people
                        are
                        leaning towards thrifting rather than supporting the fast fashion industry. </li>
                    <li><b>Accessible:</b> I am uncertain how accessible this app is. I couldn’t find any settings to
                        make it
                        easier for people with disabilities to be able to navigate. </li>
                    <li><b>Valuable:</b> The premise of the app is valuable. However, like I said with usability, there
                        are
                        many
                        other apps that can provide the same service that have better design. </li>
                </ol>
                <p>As for aspects of information architecture this app contains, I found Poshmark lacking in both
                    navigation and organization. I found the app as a whole difficult to navigate. I also found
                    labelling to be off, redundancies in the app, and a lack of functional grouping.
                    Moving forward I had two goals:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Improve Navigation.</li>
                    <li>Declutter and remove redundancies.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Testing Round One:</h3>
                <p>I interviewed five different users, tasking them with two goals.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Buy an article of clothing.</li>
                    <li>Post an item to sell.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>After conducting the interviews I came up with the following changes to the prototype:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Proceed to checkout button needs to be more prominent and stand out to the user.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add payment options at checkout.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add continue shopping button on add to cart page.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add a way to customize search criteria.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Testing Round Two:</h3>
                <p>The second round of user testing had the same goals as the previous round. In this redesign, I
                    addressed the main issues the previous users brought forward, and no new issues were brought to my
                    attention. I felt I had developed a solid redesign at this point based on the positive feedback from
                    the users.

                    <li><b>The design process doesn't end after development is completed.</b> Even the most well known
                        apps
                        can benefit from
                        continued improvment. It is important to continue to listen to the application's users to create
                        a
                        more positive experience.</li>
                    <li><b>Revolving the app around the user will aid in a more appealing application.</b></li>
