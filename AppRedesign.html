                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Poshmark is an existing application I was tasked to redesign. It is a mobile application where users
                    can either sell clothing they no
                    longer wear or buy clothing at discounted prices. The appeal of this application is users can buy
                    high end brands, such as Zara
                    and Madewell, at steep discounts. Along with this, sellers can earn some supplemental income from
                    selling what they have in their closets.
                </p>
                <p>Based on Poshmark’s designated function, to buy and sell used clothing, I asked five different people
                    to do two tasks. The first is to find three items they would like to own, and act as if they were
                    going to buy them. The second is to take an article of clothing in their closet and put it up for
                    sale. Based off of their experiences I came up with the following flaws and plan on how to fix them.
                </p>
                <h2>Flaws and Fixes</h2>
                <p>Below is a list of the seven factors that define user experience and my thoughts on how the app
                    portrayed them:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Useful: However, there is a multitude of apps out there similar to this one, and the lack of
                        usability could cause this app to get lost among all the others.</li>
                    <li>Usable: Somewhat usable. It can be difficult to specify what a user is looking for, as well as
                        navigate certain other features, which could cause them to turn away from the app. </li>
                    <li>Findable: This goes alongside usability. It is troublesome to navigate through the app to find
                        what you are looking for.</li>
                    <li>Credible: There is a lack of credibility in this app, considering anyone can post whatever they
                        so please to sell without restrictions. </li>
                    <li>Desirable: I would say this app as well as apps like this are desirable, as more people are
                        leaning towards thrifting rather than buying new. </li>
                    <li>Accessible: I am uncertain how accessible this app is. I couldn’t find any settings to make it
                        easier for people with disabilities to be able to navigate. </li>
                    <li>aluable: The premise of the app is valuable. However, like I said with usability, there are many
                        other apps that can provide the same service that have better design. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>As for aspects of information architecture this app contains, I found Poshmark lacking in both navigation and organization. I found the app as a whole difficult to navigate. I also found labelling to be off, redundancies in the app, and a lack of functional grouping. 
                    Moving forward I had two goals:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Improve Navigation.</li>
                    <li>Declutter and remove redundancies.</li>
                </ul>
