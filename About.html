                        <h1>Hello!</h1>
                        <p>My name is Kalyn Mitchell and I am a current 
                            student at Boise State University pursuing a 
                             Bachelor's in Games, Interactive Media, and 
                             Mobile Technologies. I have spent my time 
                             at University cultivating a variety of skills, 
                             including gaining experience in web development,
                             application development, and UX/UI. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As I have ventured down this path, I have developed a 
                            love for helping those in need of my services.
                            I have created applications aimed to help the greater
                            good, and strive to continue to do so throughout
                            my professional carreer. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My want to help others can be seen throughout
                            many of my projects. My most recent project completed
                            was a prototype of an application aimed to help the 
                            students at Boise State University find available parking.
                            One of my current projects is a virtual reality game 
                            that helps dog owners, specifically owners of reactive 
                            dogs, learn how to properly read their body language 
                            and gain confidence in their training.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am currently looking for an internship to gain 
                            industry experience.
